# brocode: review mode
<!-- Loaded by skills/brocode/SKILL.md when input matches: review / PR URL / MR URL -->

### `review` / `code-review`
If input is `review` or `code-review` or contains "review this PR" / "review this MR" / "review the PR" / "review MR" or includes a GitHub/GitLab PR/MR URL:

- Extract the PR/MR URL from input. If none found, ask: "Paste the PR or MR URL to review."
- Check superpowers installed: `claude plugin list | grep superpowers`
- If NOT installed: output exactly —
  ```
  superpowers required for /brocode review.
  Install: claude plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official --scope user
  Then restart Claude Code.
  ```
  Stop.
- Print: `🤝 Tech Lead → starting code review on <url>`
- Dispatch **Tech Lead** sub-agent (reads `agents/tech-lead.md`):
  - Invoke `superpowers:code-review` skill with the PR/MR URL
  - Tech Lead reviews across all domains present in the diff: backend, frontend, mobile
  - For each domain in the diff, Tech Lead dispatches the relevant sub-agent (Backend / Frontend / Mobile) to review their layer in parallel
  - Sub-agents each produce domain-scoped review findings: bugs, security issues, perf concerns, design violations, missing tests
  - Tech Lead synthesizes all findings into a single review
  - For each finding, post an **inline comment** on the exact file+line in the PR/MR via the GitHub or GitLab API:
    - GitHub PR: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments` with `path`, `line`, `body`
    - GitLab MR: `glab api projects/{id}/merge_requests/{iid}/discussions` with `position.new_path`, `position.new_line`, `body`
  - Post a top-level summary comment on the PR/MR with: overall verdict (APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES), domain breakdown, critical vs non-critical count
- Print: `✅ Tech Lead → review posted — <N> inline comments on <url>`
- Stop.
